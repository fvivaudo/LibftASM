Everything that the light does not touch is the Unterzee.

Ok, in all seriousness, why is it called the Unterzee?

Well you all know what the zee is but what about the "Unter"? Is it because it's the "Other" sea, as in a dark version of the common sea? Or is the meaning "Under" like underground sea?

Whatever you fancy, the Unterzee is where all takes place in Sunless Sea.
